    <h2>What Makes Coxwise Different From All the Rest</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Coxwise stands out because it’s built on something most consulting companies don’t have—
      <strong>real life experience, real community roots, and real results.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Where others offer generic advice, <strong>Coxwise delivers transformation.</strong>
      You don’t just get a consultant—you get a partner who understands the hustle, the struggle,
      the growth, and the responsibility of building something that lasts.
    </p>

    <div class="why-grid">
      <div class="why-item">
        <h3>1. Real-World, Multi-Industry Expertise</h3>
        <p>
          Coxwise isn’t theory. It’s landscaping, food service, tutoring, leadership, ministry,
          community programs, and business development—all built from the ground up. That diversity
          gives you <strong>solutions that actually work in real life</strong>, not just on paper.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="why-item">
        <h3>2. A Legacy-Driven Approach</h3>
        <p>
          Most companies chase clients. Coxwise builds
          <strong>generational systems</strong>—trusts, structures, strategies, and pathways that
          help families create long-term stability and impact.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="why-item">
        <h3>3. Community at the Center</h3>
        <p>
          While other firms focus on profits, Coxwise focuses on <strong>people</strong>—students,
          families, entrepreneurs, at-risk youth, and underserved communities. Coxwise is built to
          uplift, empower, and create opportunity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="why-item">
        <h3>4. Personalized Guidance, Not Cookie-Cutter Templates</h3>
        <p>
          Every client gets one-on-one attention, clear steps, tailored strategies, accountability,
          and honest feedback. No copy-paste. No vague advice.
          <strong>Everything is customized.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="why-item">
        <h3>5. The Coxwise Promise</h3>
        <p>
          Coxwise delivers <strong>Clarity</strong> (so you know what to do next),
          <strong>Confidence</strong> (so you can move with power),
          <strong>Culture</strong> (so your brand feels like you), and
          <strong>Community</strong> (so you’re never doing it alone).
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="why-item">
        <h3>6. Built From a Story, Not a Corporation</h3>
        <p>
          Coxwise reflects a real journey—the grind, the discipline, the leadership, the sacrifices,
          the lessons, and the victories. It’s not just a business.
          <strong>It’s a mission. It’s a lifestyle. It’s a movement.</strong>
